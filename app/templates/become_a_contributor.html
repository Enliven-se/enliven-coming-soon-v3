<h3 id="we-share-the-revenue.-did-we-mention-you-get-70">We share the revenue. Did we mention, you get 70%!</h3>
<p>Publishing is a talent business (like any other industry). So why is it so that so many gifted people are paid so little and that much of the money ends up with expensive publishing executives, fancy headquarters and shareholder profits?</p>
<p>You are the talent! By building a new generation publishing model, ENLIVEN contributors will share 70% of our total revenues (mainly subscriptions and ad’s).</p>
<p>ENLIVEN has the long-term vision to be the best paying publishing platform in the world. Sure it will (just like Spotify and the likes) take some time, but if we work as a team we will get there.</p>
