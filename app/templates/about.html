        <p>The ENLIVEN story started in Southern France in the summer of 2015, when we realized that, for us, glossy print magazines had lost their appeal. The blogosphere and social media platforms also didn’t meet our high expectations. We wanted something else – we wanted more.</p>
        <p>We all draw inspiration from our interests and hobbies, but the Internet is flooded with uninspired content and clickbait – who has the time? We wanted a curated selection of lifestyle articles, personalized just for us.</p>
        <p>That’s why we created ENLIVEN, for you.</p>
