        <p>The ENLIVEN story started in Southern France in the summer of 2015 when we realized that glossy print magazines were losing their appeal. The blogosphere and social media don’t meet our high expectations. We wanted something else – we wanted more.</p>
        <p>We all draw inspiration from our interests and hobbies, but unfortunately the Internet is flooded with uninspired content and clickbait – who has the time? We wanted a curated selection of lifestyle articles and contributors personalized just for us.</p>
        <p>That’s why we created ENLIVEN, for you.</p>
