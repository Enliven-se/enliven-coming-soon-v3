        <p>The story about ENLIVEN, our startup, starts in Southern France in the summer of 2015, where we realized that the glossy print magazines didn’t really appeal to us any more. At the same time the blogosphere and social media platforms didn’t either
          meet our highly set expectations. We wanted something else, we wanted more.</p>
        <p>Most of us have multiple interests that we continously want to follow and get inspired within. Time is always a constraint, while the Internet is flooded with crappy content and clickbait. Isn’t what we really want a curated selection of lifestyle
          articles packaged in highly personalized magazine?</p>
        <p>We believe so. Therefore we created ENLIVEN.</p>

        <p>For our contributors ENLIVEN has the vision to be an publishing platform connecting you directly with the subscribers (think Uber, but in publishing).</p>
        <p>Together we co-create inspiring articles within our favourite topics, marrying fantastic photography or footage with great writing, regardless if its mountain climbing, literature or interior design We want ENLIVEN to be one of your primary revenue
          channels, rather than another marketing platform.</p>
        <p>We hope we have started to inspire you and look forward getting your feedback!</p>
