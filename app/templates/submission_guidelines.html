        <p class="overview">If you're interested in contributing to ENLIVEN, you may find the following submission guidelines useful throughout your application process.</p>
        <p class="overview">Enliven will launch in Summer 2017 and are looking for high-caliber contributors who want to join early and be part of forming our future.</p>
        <h2>Who Is ENLIVEN For?</h2>
        <p>Our primary target group is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Affluent Generation X and Millenials (25-55 years) who want to be inspired and engaged within their multiple areas of interest and hobbies</li>
            <li>Both men and women, but particularly women</li>
            <li>Individuals with relatively high income levels and purchasing power</li>
            <li>Our audience demands quality, and is willing to pay for it</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What Are We Looking For?</h2>
        <p>Enliven aims to offer creativity and storytelling front and center:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strong, opinionated and highly talented contributors – we would rather set the agenda than follow others</li>
            <li>High-low - offering “glossy” articles side-by-side with more in-depth or challenging subjects</li>
            <li>An international outlook - a great story has no borders (of course depending subject & scope of article)</li>
            <li>High-end mass market - Enliven is not artistically driven, but looks style-wise to attract a relatively broad and affluent audience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are interested in pitches for engaging pieces in a variety of editorial formats including, but not limited to, articles, “look books”, columns, Q and A-style interviews, think pieces, list posts, reaction pieces and reviews. Text should fall
            in the 150 - 2000 word range identifiable as “lifestyle topics”.</p>
        <p>Please note that ENLIVEN accepts all quality works, even those that may have been previously published in any venue elsewhere. This includes also all forms of digital self-publishing.</p>
        <p>However, note that all articles published on ENLIVEN will go through our editing process to ensure that published material meets our highly set standards.</p>
        <h2>What Are We Not Looking For?</h2>
        <p>Please send us clear, thoroughly outlined pitches on specific topics which you are passionate about and would like to contribute within. If you are not already registered, please do so <a href="https://cms.enliven.co/en/contributor-application-form">here</a>.</p>
        <p>We do not accept work that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is not identifiable as lifestyle or does not fit the current sections that we are covering including, but not limited to, journalistic pieces covering current news, business, politics, and sports.</li>
            <li>Falls far outside our target length of 150 - 2000 words</li>
            <li>Falls within the categories of blogs, video blogging, Kickstarter projects, or promotional/marketing materials</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are a consumer brand with a project or editorial articles that you think our readers will appreciate, please <a href="/contact">contact our sales team</a> to discuss possible collaborations.</p>
        <h2>Tips For Successful Pitch Proposals</h2>
        <p>Tell us a bit about yourself, your topic, and your previous experience. The best proposals will also answer the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who is your target audience?</li>
            <li>What angle are you taking?</li>
            <li>How will your piece inspire and/or challenge your audience?</li>
            <li>Why is this article relevant?</li>
            <li>Do you have the access required to create your piece?</li>
            <li>When do you expect to be able to complete your final submission?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How To Submit</h2>
        <p>Please <a href="https://cms.enliven.co/en/contributor-application-form">register</a> to be able to submit pitches or finished articles. Once you’ve registered there, you can use the same Enliven platform to communicate with our editors, check
            the status of your submission, etc.
        </p>
        <p>We may not be able to respond to your pitch immediately, but if we are able to accommodate extra content and your proposed article sounds like a good fit, we will try to do so within one week.</p>

        <p>A note on editing: We may request rewrites before publishing your article. We will not make significant changes to an article’s content without permission, but please be aware that we may lightly edit your post for grammar, spelling, and general
