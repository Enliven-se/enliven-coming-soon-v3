                <span class="dropcap-red">C</span>reatives publish articles and content within a wide variety of topics on Enliven. Sometimes they
                reference companies or products. Sometimes they subtly (or not so subtly) might promote a specific brand.
                That&rsquo;s ok for us as long as it&rsquo;s not hidden promotion or marketing of the brand where the creative
                or editor directly or indirectly is compensated by the brand to promote their brand or products on Enliven.</p>
            <h2>What&rsquo;s a trademark?</h2>
            <p>A trademark can be lots of things, but usually it&rsquo;s a word, phrase or design (like a company name, a product
                name, a slogan or a logo). It shows you that this good or service comes from one company as opposed to some
                other company.
            </p>
            <p>Trademarks exist to prevent consumer confusion over the source of a particular good or service. They also stop
                one company from free-riding on another company&rsquo;s investment in branding. By contrast, they do not
                exist to help a company stop someone from discussing it (or its products) or to end secondary markets.</p>

                    <li>You have a good faith belief that use of the trademark is not authorized by the trademark owner</li>
                    <li>You have determined in good faith after a reasoned analysis that the use of the trademark is not fair
                        use</li>
                    <li>The information in your notice is accurate</li>

                </li>
            </ol>

            So if someone&rsquo;s using your trademark, in what scenarios would Enliven not take it&nbsp;down?
            <ul>
                <li>If they&rsquo;re using it in a way not likely to confuse anyone about the source of a good/service.</li>
                <li>If they are making fair use of it, such as&nbsp;
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_use" target="_blank">nominative fair use</a>. This is when someone uses a trademark to refer to a company or brand, not to
                    indicate it is the source of a good or service. For example, if someone writes a story about Company
                    X and in that story uses the phrase &ldquo;Company X&rdquo; to refer to &ldquo;Company X,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s
                    probably fair use. Even if &ldquo;Company X&rdquo; is your trademark. People are allowed to use your
                    company or product name to write things, even negative things, about your company/product/brand. As long
                    as they&rsquo;re not confusing anyone about whether you authorized or endorse the post.</li>
            </ul>
